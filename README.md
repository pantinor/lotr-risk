Lord of the Rings RISK
======================

Personal project to make video game with LOTR Risk board game.

With AI for strong, weak and random bots.

Some of the POWER cards are not fully implemented.

To run this, you will need to install java first (if not already installed), and then extract 
this binary zip archive and double click on the main jar file (gdx-risk-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/gdx-risk-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar).
